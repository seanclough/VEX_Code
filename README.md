# VEX_Code
These are a few old python files from my time doing VEX Robotics before I switched to C++ and the PROS package.

The auto_spin_x_drive code is fully functional holonomic drive code, including global heading. This allows the robot to spin and move in any direction at the same time. This was my covid project. 

The Modulo_4m_Drive code showcases a full codebase required to control a VEX robot. It includes multiple autonomous routines, which feature PI control loops to accurately position the robot. It also includes macros in the driver control section to allow the driver to easily move the mobile goal lift to different predefined locations and raise the lift for mobile goal grasping. 

Here is a video of a later version of the doubleYellow autonomous routine working:
